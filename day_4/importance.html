    <h3 style="color: brown;">What is the Significance of the Four Temples?</h3>
 <center style="color: chocolate;"><big>Jagannatha Temple</big></center>
    The Puri Jagannatha Temple is over 1000 years old and dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is also the only temple where Krishna is venerated along with his siblings Subadra and Balarama. The main deities and the Sudarshana Chakra are made from neem wood. In fact, worshipping of the deities predates the temple and is supposedly on Earth from the Treta Yuga itself.

    <center style="color: chocolate;"><big>Rameshwaram Ramanathaswamy Temple</big></center>
    This temple is believed to have been consecrated by Lord Rama after returning from Lanka to absolve himself of Brahmahatti dosha because Ravana was a Brahmin. In fact, did you know Ravana even performed the yagna before building the Ram Sethu, as he was the only Brahmin who had never missed his puja and the only eligible person to complete the yagna? It is one of the 12 jyothirlinga sites where Shiva is venerated as a pillar of light.

    <center style="color: chocolate;"><big>Dwaraka Krishna Temple</big></center>
    The Dwarka Temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna and literally means Gateway of Moksha. It is believed to be the original abode of Krishna and was submerged in the sea. The modern-day temple was built 2,500 years ago by Vajranabh, the great-grandson of Lord Krishna. The temple was renovated several times, the latest in the 16th and 18th centuries. The main deities here include Dwarkadheesh, Balrama, Pradyumna, and Anirudha, the last two being the grandsons of Lord Krishna.

    <center style="color: chocolate;"><big>Badrinarayan Temple</big></center>
    The Badrinath Temple is often called Bhuvaikunta and is situated on the banks of the Alaknanda River. The temple is open only from April to November and is closed in other months due to the extreme weather. The main deity of the temple is Badrinarayan, and made of black stone. It is believed that the temple could have been built during the Vedic period, i.e., around 1750 to 500 BC. It is mentioned in several ancient texts, including the Vishnu Purana, Skanda Purana, Mahabharata, and the Divya Prabhandas.
