     <br>
     According to a popular legend, Lord Vishnu came to the present-day site of the Badrinath 
     temple seeking a quiet place where he could meditate. Enveloped by the undisturbed peace,
      Vishnu was so deeply engrossed in meditation, he could not even feel the bitter cold 
      against his body. Goddess Lakshmi, who was his consort, manifested herself in the form
       of a Badri Tree (also known as Jujube) to make sure he was protected from extreme weather
        conditions. Impressed by Lakshmi's devotion, Lord Vishnu named this site Badrikashram.

 One of the char dhams Gangotri, in Uttarkashi, is a small town with the temple of Goddess
  Ganga at its heart. A 12-hour drive from Rishikesh, Gangotri is nestled among lofty Garhwal 
  Himalayan peaks, glaciers and dense forests, and is one of highest pilgrimages in India.
 According to Hindu legends, the most sacred of all rivers, Ganges (or Ganga), 
 descended from heaven to earth at Gangotri, when Lord Shiva released the mighty river from
  his locks. The actual origin of the river is at Gaumukh in the Gangotri glacier, 19 km away
 from Gangotri and is accessible by trekking. After it originates from Gaumukh, the river is
     known as Bhagirathi and it acquires the name 'Ganga' after the river Alaknanda merges into
 it near the town of Devaprayag.

    Gangotri Dham occupies a special position amongst the other pilgrimage sites of the Chota
     Char Dham because it is the origin of the Ganges, the holiest river for the Hindus. It is 
     said that Bhagirath, the grandson of King Sagara, to free his ancestors from the curse of
      Sage Kapila, undertook penance for 1000 years to please Ganga to descend on earth.
   At last, his endeavors proved to be fruitful, and River Ganga, satisfied by his commitment, 
   arrived on earth. This is the reason; Ganga is also called Bhagirathi. Because of her pride,
    and the way that the earth would be crushed if Ganga descended in her full power, Lord 
    Shiva kept her in his locks. The holy stone close to the temple is the place where Ganga
     first descended on earth. According to Hindus, taking a dip in the river Ganga frees
      people from their sins.
